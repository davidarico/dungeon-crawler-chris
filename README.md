A TTRPG inspired by Dungeon Crawler Carl.
Created and maintained by Chris and David

## TODO
- [X] Add Google Login
- [/] Transition from Mock Data to Supabase (In Progress)
- [ ] Rework Item List to Allow for Multiple Filters
- [ ] Change Gold to Crawler Credit
- [ ] Rework Inventory to have Separate Sections for:
       1. Weapons
	2. Sheilds
	3. Head
	4. Chest
	5. Legs
	6. Hands
	7. Feet
	8. Neck
	9. Rings (Maybe WoW rules of having 2)
	Then every other item is just in the regular item pool (your toasters, torches, food, potions, etc) 
- [ ] Add Visual Indication for Armor Slots (WoW Character Pane Inspiration)
- [ ] Stream Database Changes so the DM sees Player Sheet Changes and Vice Versa
