## TODO
- [X] Add Google Login

- [X] Migrate Database off of Supabase
- [ ] Implement a Migration Framework to Handle Database Changes
- [ ] Rework Item List to Allow for Multiple Filters
- [ ] Change Gold to Crawler Credit
- [/] Rework Inventory to have Separate Sections for:
    1. Weapons
	2. Sheilds
	3. Head
	4. Chest
	5. Legs
	6. Hands
	7. Feet
	8. Neck
